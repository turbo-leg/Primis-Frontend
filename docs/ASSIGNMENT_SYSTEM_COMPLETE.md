# Assignment Submission & Grading System - Complete ✅

## Overview

The assignment submission and grading system has been successfully implemented with full backend APIs. This enables teachers to create and manage assignments, students to submit work, and teachers to grade submissions.

## Backend Implementation

### Database Models

- **Assignment**: Stores assignment details (title, description, due date, max points, instructions)
- **AssignmentSubmission**: Tracks student submissions (text, file URL, grade, feedback)

### Teacher APIs

#### 1. Create Assignment

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/teachers/assignments`

```json
{
  "course_id": 1,
  "title": "Math Homework - Chapter 5",
  "description": "Complete all exercises from Chapter 5",
  "due_date": "2025-10-26T23:59:59",
  "max_points": 100.0,
  "instructions": "Show all work for full credit"
}
```

**Response**: Assignment details with submission count

#### 2. Get Assignment Submissions

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/teachers/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions`
**Response**: List of all student submissions for the assignment

```json
[
  {
    "submission_id": 1,
    "student_id": 5,
    "student_name": "John Doe",
    "submission_text": "Solutions to the exercises...",
    "file_url": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
    "submitted_at": "2025-10-25T14:30:00",
    "grade": null,
    "feedback": null
  }
]
```

#### 3. Grade Submission

**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/teachers/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{submission_id}/grade`

```json
{
  "grade": 85.5,
  "feedback": "Great work! You showed all your work clearly."
}
```

**Response**: Confirmation with grading timestamp

### Student APIs

#### 1. Submit Assignment

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/students/assignments/{assignment_id}/submit`
**Supports**:

- Text submission via form field
- File upload (any format, uploaded to Cloudinary)
- Both text and file together

**Form Data**:

```
submission_text: "My answer to the assignment..."
file: (binary file)
```

**Response**: Submission confirmation

```json
{
  "message": "Assignment submitted successfully",
  "submission_id": 1,
  "submitted_at": "2025-10-25T14:30:00"
}
```

#### 2. Get Assignment Submission

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/students/assignments/{assignment_id}/submission`
**Response**: Student's submission details including grade if graded

### Key Features

✅ **File Upload Integration**

- Uses Cloudinary for secure file storage
- Supports any file format (PDF, images, documents, etc.)
- Automatic URL generation for file retrieval

✅ **Permission & Authorization**

- Teachers can only manage assignments in their courses
- Students can only submit to courses they're enrolled in
- Students can only view their own submissions

✅ **Validation**

- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Validates grade is within max points
- Verifies student enrollment before submission

✅ **Notifications**

- Students notified when new assignments are posted
- Notification system integrated but email delivery needs implementation

✅ **Error Handling**

- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Rollback on database errors

## Existing Features Integration

### With Existing APIs

- **Get Teacher Assignments**: `GET /api/teachers/{teacher_id}/assignments` - Already existed, now fully utilized
- **Get Student Assignments**: `GET /api/students/{student_id}/assignments` - Enhanced with submission status tracking
- **Upcoming Assignments**: `GET /api/students/assignments/upcoming` - Shows unsubmitted assignments for next 30 days

### Database Relationships

```
Teacher → Course (admin_id)
          ↓
        Assignment (course_id)
          ↓
    AssignmentSubmission (student_id, assignment_id)
          ↓
        Student
```

## File Structure

### Backend Files Modified/Created

```
backend/app/api/
├── teachers.py        # NEW: Create assignments, view submissions, grade
├── students.py        # NEW: Submit assignments, get submissions
└── auth.py           # (existing) Role-based access control

backend/app/models/
├── models.py         # (existing) Assignment & AssignmentSubmission models
└── notification_models.py  # Notification infrastructure

backend/app/services/
└── notification_service.py # Helper functions for notifications

backend/app/utils/
└── cloudinary_helper.py    # File upload utilities
```

## Testing with Docker

### Start Development Environment

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Services will start:

- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically on container startup via:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Next Steps - Frontend Implementation

### Teacher Dashboard Components Needed

- [ ] Assignment creation form
- [ ] Assignment submission viewer/grader
- [ ] Grade distribution charts
- [ ] Student performance tracking

### Student Dashboard Components Needed

- [ ] Assignment list view
- [ ] Assignment detail and instructions
- [ ] Submission form with file upload
- [ ] Grades and feedback view

### Shared Components

- [ ] File upload component (with progress)
- [ ] Assignment card component
- [ ] Submission status badge
- [ ] Grade display component

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Cloudinary (for file uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/college_prep

# JWT
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256

# Email (when implementing)
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## API Documentation

All endpoints are fully documented and can be accessed via Swagger UI:

- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Database Schema

### Assignments Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE assignments (
    assignment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    due_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    max_points FLOAT DEFAULT 100.0,
    instructions TEXT,
    created_by_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Assignment Submissions Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE assignment_submissions (
    submission_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    assignment_id INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY,
    submission_text TEXT,
    file_url VARCHAR(500),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP,
    grade FLOAT,
    feedback TEXT,
    graded_at TIMESTAMP,
    graded_by_id INTEGER
);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Submissions indexed by assignment_id and student_id
- Cloudinary handles file storage (off-loads from database)
- Notification service is async-compatible
- Database queries use efficient joins and filtering

## Security Features

✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based with role verification
✅ **Authorization**: Role-based access control (student/teacher/admin)
✅ **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for all requests
✅ **File Upload**: Secure file handling via Cloudinary
✅ **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages
