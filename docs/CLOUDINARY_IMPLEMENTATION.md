# ☁️ Cloudinary Integration - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Cloudinary cloud storage integration for the College Prep Platform.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dependencies Added**

**File:** `backend/requirements.txt`

```python
cloudinary==1.36.0  # Cloud storage SDK
```

### 2. **Configuration Updated**

**File:** `backend/app/core/config.py`

```python
# New settings added:
cloudinary_cloud_name: str
cloudinary_api_key: str
cloudinary_api_secret: str
use_cloudinary: bool  # Toggle between local/cloud storage
```

**File:** `backend/.env.example`

```bash
USE_CLOUDINARY=False
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### 3. **Cloudinary Helper Created**

**File:** `backend/app/utils/cloudinary_helper.py`

New utility functions:

- `upload_file()` - Upload any file to Cloudinary
- `delete_file()` - Delete file from Cloudinary
- `get_file_info()` - Get file metadata
- `generate_upload_url()` - Create signed upload URLs

### 4. **QR Code Generator Updated**

**File:** `backend/app/utils/qr_generator.py`

**Before:**

```python
# Saved to local filesystem
file_path = os.path.join(settings.qr_code_dir, filename)
img.save(file_path)
return f"/{settings.qr_code_dir}/{filename}"
```

**After:**

```python
# Uploads to Cloudinary if enabled
if settings.use_cloudinary:
    result = upload_file(
        file_content=buffer.getvalue(),
        folder="qr_codes",
        resource_type="image"
    )
    return result['secure_url']  # Returns CDN URL
else:
    # Fallback to local storage
    img.save(file_path)
    return f"/{settings.qr_code_dir}/{filename}"
```

### 5. **Materials Upload Updated**

**File:** `backend/app/api/materials.py`

**Before:**

```python
# Saved files locally
file_path = os.path.join(upload_dir, unique_filename)
with open(file_path, "wb") as buffer:
    buffer.write(content)
url = f"/uploads/materials/{unique_filename}"
```

**After:**

```python
# Uploads to Cloudinary if enabled
if settings.use_cloudinary:
    result = upload_file(
        file_content=content,
        folder="course_materials",
        resource_type="auto"  # Auto-detects file type
    )
    file_url = result['secure_url']
else:
    # Fallback to local storage
    with open(file_path, "wb") as buffer:
        buffer.write(content)
    file_url = f"/uploads/materials/{unique_filename}"
```

### 6. **Main App Updated**

**File:** `backend/app/main.py`

**Changes:**

- Only creates local directories if `USE_CLOUDINARY=False`
- Only mounts static files if `USE_CLOUDINARY=False`

**Before:**

```python
# Always created local directories
os.makedirs(settings.upload_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(settings.qr_code_dir, exist_ok=True)
# Always served static files
app.mount("/uploads", StaticFiles(directory="uploads"), name="uploads")
```

**After:**

```python
# Only for local development
if not settings.use_cloudinary:
    os.makedirs(settings.upload_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(settings.qr_code_dir, exist_ok=True)
    app.mount("/uploads", StaticFiles(directory="uploads"), name="uploads")
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Development Mode (Local)

```bash
# In .env
USE_CLOUDINARY=False
```

**Behavior:**

- Files saved to `uploads/` and `qr_codes/` folders
- Served via FastAPI StaticFiles
- No internet required
- Faster for testing

### Production Mode (Deployed)

```bash
# In Render/Railway environment
USE_CLOUDINARY=True
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

**Behavior:**

- All files uploaded to Cloudinary
- URLs returned: `https://res.cloudinary.com/.../file.ext`
- Global CDN delivery
- Persistent storage (survives restarts)

---

## 🎯 What Files Are Affected

### 1. **Student QR Codes**

**Generated:** When student registers  
**Used by:** Attendance scanning, student dashboard  
**Storage:** `qr_codes/` folder → Cloudinary  
**Example URL:**

```
Before: http://localhost:8000/qr_codes/qr_student123.png
After:  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/qr_codes/qr_student123.png
```

### 2. **Course Materials**

**Uploaded by:** Teachers, admins  
**Used by:** Students in course details page  
**Storage:** `uploads/materials/` folder → Cloudinary  
**File types:** PDFs, videos, documents, presentations, archives  
**Example URL:**

```
Before: http://localhost:8000/uploads/materials/abc123.pdf
After:  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/course_materials/abc123.pdf
```

### 3. **Future: Profile Pictures, Assignments**

The infrastructure is ready for:

- Student/teacher profile pictures
- Assignment submissions
- Message attachments
- Any other file uploads

Just use the `upload_file()` helper with appropriate folder names.

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Free Tier (Sufficient for MVP)

| Resource            | Free Limit   | Estimated Usage     |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **Storage**         | 25 GB        | ~1 GB (1000 users)  |
| **Bandwidth**       | 25 GB/month  | ~5 GB/month         |
| **Transformations** | 25,000/month | ~1,000/month        |
| **Status**          | ✅ FREE      | ✅ More than enough |

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade to paid tier ($99/month) when:

- Storage > 20 GB (15,000+ users)
- Bandwidth > 20 GB/month (heavy usage)
- Need advanced features (video streaming, AI)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Secure

- API secret stored in environment variables (never in code)
- HTTPS URLs for all uploaded files
- Files accessible only via secure URLs
- `.env` file in `.gitignore`

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Public URLs by default** - All uploaded files are publicly accessible if you know the URL
2. **For private files** - Use Cloudinary's `type="private"` parameter (requires signed URLs)
3. **API Secret** - NEVER expose in frontend code
4. **Rate limiting** - Cloudinary has built-in rate limits
