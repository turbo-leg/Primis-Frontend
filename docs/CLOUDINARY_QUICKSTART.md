# ðŸš€ Quick Start - Cloudinary Setup

## For Local Development (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Use Local Storage (Easiest)

```bash
# In backend/.env
USE_CLOUDINARY=False
```

That's it! Files will save to local folders. âœ…

### Option 2: Use Cloudinary (Optional)

1. **Sign up:** https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. **Get credentials** from dashboard
3. **Add to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   USE_CLOUDINARY=True
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```
4. **Install:**
   ```bash
   pip install cloudinary
   ```
5. **Test:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_cloudinary.py
   ```

## For Production Deployment (Required)

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account

- Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
- No credit card needed
- Free tier: 25GB storage

### 2. Add to Render Environment Variables

```bash
USE_CLOUDINARY=True
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### 3. That's it!

Files will now upload to Cloudinary cloud storage instead of local filesystem.
