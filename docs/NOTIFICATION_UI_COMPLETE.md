## 🎨 UI Features

### Visual Indicators

- **Unread Badge**: Blue dot + count on bell icon
- **Priority Colors**:
  - 🔴 Urgent: Red
  - 🟠 High: Orange
  - 🔵 Medium: Blue
  - ⚪ Low: Gray
- **Unread Highlight**: Blue background tint

- **Status Dot**: Blue dot for unread items

### User Interactions

- Click notification → Navigate to action URL
- Click bell → Toggle dropdown
- Click outside → Close dropdown
- Mark as read → Remove unread indicator
- Delete → Remove from list
- Mark all as read → Clear all unread

## 🔌 API Integration

All endpoints from the backend are integrated:

```typescript
GET /api/v1/notifications?unread_only=false&limit=50
GET /api/v1/notifications/count
PUT /api/v1/notifications/{id}/read
PUT /api/v1/notifications/read-all
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/{id}
GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences
PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences
```

```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Logs In

- `AuthenticatedLayout` renders
- `NotificationBell` component loads
- `useNotificationCount()` hook fetches count
- Badge shows unread count

### 2. User Clicks Bell

- Dropdown panel opens
- `useNotifications()` hook fetches list
- Shows last 50 notifications
- Can filter All/Unread

### 3. User Interacts

- **Click notification**:
  - Marks as read (if unread)
  - Navigates to action URL
  - Closes dropdown
- **Click mark button**: Marks as read
- **Click delete button**: Deletes notification
- **Click "View all"**: Goes to full page

### 4. Auto-Refresh

- Count updates every 15 seconds
- List updates every 30 seconds
- Keeps user informed of new notifications

## 🎯 Next Steps to Test

### 1. Make sure backend is running

```bash
cd college-prep-platform
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Create migration for notification tables

```bash
docker-compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add notification system"
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Test the frontend

- Login to the app
- Look for bell icon in header (next to theme toggle)
- Badge should show "0" initially
- Click bell to open dropdown

### 4. Create test notifications

Using the API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs:

```python
# Example: Create a test notification
POST /api/v1/admin/notifications
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "user_type": "student",
  "notification_type": "announcement",
  "title": "Welcome to the Platform!",
  "message": "This is your first notification. Click to explore.",
  "priority": "medium",
  "action_url": "/dashboard/student",
  "action_text": "Go to Dashboard"
}
```

Or use the notification service in your backend code:

```python
from app.services.notification_service import NotificationService
from app.models.notification_models import NotificationType, NotificationPriority

service = NotificationService(db)
service.create_notification(
    user_id=1,
    user_type="student",
    notification_type=NotificationType.ANNOUNCEMENT,
    title="Test Notification",
    message="This is a test notification!",
    priority=NotificationPriority.HIGH,
    action_url="/dashboard/student",
    action_text="View Dashboard"
)
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Refresh Intervals

In `useNotifications.ts`:

```typescript
// Change count refresh (default: 15s)
refetchInterval: 15000;

// Change list refresh (default: 30s)
refetchInterval: 30000;
```

### Change Items Per Page

In `NotificationBell.tsx` and `useNotifications()`:

```typescript
params: { unread_only: unreadOnly, limit: 50 } // Change 50 to desired number
```

### Add Notification Sounds

In `NotificationBell.tsx`, add audio when count increases:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (previousCount !== undefined && unreadCount > previousCount) {
    const audio = new Audio("/notification-sound.mp3");
    audio.play();
  }
  setPreviousCount(unreadCount);
}, [unreadCount]);
```

## 🎨 Theming

All components support light/dark mode with Primis color scheme:

- Light: White backgrounds, gray borders
- Dark: Primis Navy backgrounds, white/10 borders

Classes used:

- `dark:bg-primis-navy-light`
- `dark:bg-primis-navy-dark`
- `dark:border-white/10`
- `dark:text-white`

## 📊 Performance

- **React Query Caching**: Prevents unnecessary API calls
- **Polling**: Background refresh without user interaction
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Lazy Loading**: Full page loads only when accessed
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Only affected components update

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bell icon not showing?

- Check `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx` has the import
- Verify user is logged in
- Check browser console for errors

### Count not updating?

- Check API endpoint returns correct data
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Check network tab for failed requests

### Notifications not loading?

- Check backend is running
- Verify migration was applied
- Check API returns notifications array

### Dark mode issues?

- Verify `ThemeProvider` is set up
- Check Tailwind dark: classes are correct
- Test theme toggle functionality
