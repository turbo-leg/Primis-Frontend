# Notification Sound
# 
# For mobile notifications to work properly, add a notification-sound.mp3 file to the public directory.
# This file should be a short (1-2 second) notification sound that plays for urgent/high priority notifications.
# 
# Recommended specifications:
# - Format: MP3
# - Duration: 1-2 seconds
# - Size: < 100KB
# - Volume: Medium (will be adjusted by the app)
# 
# The app will automatically play this sound for mobile users when they receive urgent or high-priority notifications.
# On iOS, this only works after the user has interacted with the page (due to browser restrictions).
